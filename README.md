# towntools

this repo should contain at some point mocks for common things that are available in every municipality (in Germany for now), think citizen registry, budgeting system, kita registry etc etc.

This should (eventually) offload the burden of working with the every software-vendor of every municipality directley to get specific API integrations.

The process should be now

1. clone the repo and see what is already there
2. develop a product based on the exising APIs and with the mocks
3. work with the municipality and the community to make a towntools connector
4. open source your connector for the next person that comes along

If the standard that you are looking for is not here, the community is more than happy to talk to you and implement this.

Let me know what you think lukas@rambold.de

Let's do this ðŸ’ª
